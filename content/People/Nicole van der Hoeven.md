Bio:
	Hi, I'm Nicole van der Hoeven. I'm a Developer Advocate at k6.io (Grafana Labs). I've spent my career making software faster as a performance engineer, but I'm also a YouTuber. I write stuff, film and produce videos, speak at conferences, and otherwise just generally learn in public. This site is a home for everything I'm doing on the interwebs. I currently live between two places: Portugal and the Netherlands.
