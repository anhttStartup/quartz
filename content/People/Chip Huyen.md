**Bio**
I’m Chip Huyen, a writer and computer scientist. I grew up chasing grasshoppers in a small rice-farming village in Vietnam.

I’m a co-founder of [Claypot AI](https://claypot.ai/), a platform for [real-time machine learning](https://huyenchip.com/2022/01/02/real-time-machine-learning-challenges-and-solutions.html). Previously, I built machine learning tools at NVIDIA, [Snorkel AI](https://snorkel.ai/), Netflix, and [Primer](https://primer.ai/).

I graduated from Stanford University, where I currently teach [CS 329S: Machine Learning Systems Design](https://cs329s.stanford.edu/). My O’Reilly book [Designing Machine Learning Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Machine-Learning-Systems-Production-Ready/dp/1098107969) is an Amazon #1 bestseller in Artificial Intelligence (very proud)!

LinkedIn included me among [Top Voices in Software Development (2019)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-top-voices-2019-software-development-daniel-bean/) and [Top Voices in Data Science & AI (2020)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-top-voices-2020-data-science-ai-jessi-hempel/).

In my free time, I travel and write. After high school, I went to Brunei for a 3-day vacation which turned into a 3-year trip through Asia, Africa, and South America. During my trip, I worked as a Bollywood extra, a casino hostess, and a street performer.

I spend a lot of time learning about machine learning production, and I maintain a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Mw77HPrgjF) to learn together with people who share similar interests. Join us if you want to learn too!
